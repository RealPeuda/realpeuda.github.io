    <h1>My top 5 favourite music albums :)))</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: left;">David Bowie - <strong>Blackstar</strong></h2>
    <div class="album-images">

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        David Bowie is an absolute legend, so ofc once he found out he had cancer he decided to make the most 🔥✍ album since 
        Hunky Dory and other <i>milk and cocaine</i> era albums hit the shelves. It's a mix of prog jazz and rock, with a hint of that classic Bowie flashyness and performanceship. 
        The first song - Blackstar - explores death and it feels the most sane of the songs. Most of the other songs, I interpret is life
        flashing before one's eyes. In fact, I'd say the whole album <i>stinks</i> of death, if that makes sense. <br />
        The album is certainly a very unique experience, and everyone should listen to it. It's not something I'd put on a playlist, but more
        of an artistic use of music Bowie uses to let out his feelings in his final years of life, knowing it's coming to a close. <br />
        You are forever a legend. Rest in peace Bowie. <br /><br />

    <h2 style="text-align: left;">きくおはな (Kikuohana) - <strong>第一幕 and 第二幕 (Daihitomaku and Dainimaku)</strong></h2>
    <div class="album-images">
        <img src="Daihitomaku.jpg" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
        <img src="Dainimaku.jpg">

    <p style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 250px;">
        きくおはな (Kikuohana) is a duo consisting of きくお (Kikuo) and 花たん (Hanatan). Now, I abosolutely adore Kikuo's instrumentals, they're so intoxicating and creative, 
        but I CANNOT for the life of me stand vocaloid music (Unless it's Lagtrain, or that <a href="https://youtu.be/1CQfEg7Q_zg?si=eHuWZldTrU1Kql8J">Loop Spinner video with calculus</a>).
        But when they are sung by humans, especially if sung by such impressive singers as Hanatan... Now that, I can get behind. <br />
        All the songs in the two albums are super theatrical (hence why they're literally called "Act one" and "Act two" lol), intense, and somber. 
        They revolve around stories of children getting bullied, left alone, and all around feeling like they're just actors on a stage that need to perform (行かないで、この劇場から 🗣️❗❗). <br />
        The instrumentals are kinda insane (in a good way). They're all digitally produced as far as I'm aware, and I admit that I will never be able to play most of these songs on the drumset
        even though they are totally playable. <br />
        If you enjoy mental turmoil music™ or just mental turmoil™ in general, I would totally recommend having a listen. <br /><br />
