    <h1>This is completely inconsequential and my life has no meaning (normal distribution)</h1>
    <p>
        Ok, so... I am an absolute nerd. And I like things to be <i>a e s t h e t i c</i>™.<br />
        AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE CREATED A RATING SYSTEM THAT WILL GIVE A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION OF SCORE!!! <br />
        As proof, here's what my anime score graph looks like. <br />
        <img src="anime_graph.jpg" style="height: 200px;">
    </p>
    <p>And this is where I share the secret sauce, in case YOU want to kiss Gauss on the lips as much as I do!</p>

    <h2 id="score-system">How I rate things</h2>
    <p>
        Using a variety of categories for rating, and rating them to where 50% is the standard score in each category, adding and subtracting points as one sees fit, it's pretty easy to make something that will result in a normal distribution. <br />
        These are the categories I use:
        <div class="score_system">
            <dt>/20P entertainment value</dt>
            <dt>/40P personal impact</dt>
            <dt>/20P emotional impact</dt>
            <dt>/30P substance</dt>
            <dt>/30P chops</dt>
            <dt>/30P creativity</dt>
            <dt>/20P narrative </dt>
            <dt>/20P pacing</dt>
            <dt>/20P characters</dt>
            <dt>/20P world</dt>
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Entertainment value is pretty self explanitory. Did I have fun, and how much fun did I have? What you might be asking is why isn't it the sole criteria.
        Is entertainment not the most important part of art? Well, for me, no. It's perfectly fine if you give entertainment value more weight than I do, but I just find it
        to be far too contingent on other factors (like my mood, who I'm with, etc) to give it more weight.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think of personal impact as an extention of entertainment beyond just the duration of the work. So basically how much I think about the work. This one I think is less
        variable, and more important, so it has twice as much weight as entertainment value. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Emotional impact is like a combination of entertainment value and personal impact. It's about investment and connection I feel to the story while watching/reading. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When I talk about substance I talk about the universality of a work's themes, how they are presented, and how important they are. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Think about an artists skill in their craft. Completely ignore their creative input and focus only on their proficiency. How would we call that? I call it chops, 
        it's drumming lingo for your entire literal physical drumming ability, for lack of a better term. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think we all understand what creativity is. How different is the work from others like it? How much does it stand out? How much does it fall into the common traps? 
        These are all questions I ask myself when considering creativity. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Narrative to me is about different parts of a story falling into place in a way that makes sense. All details should me taken into account and nothing should be 
        put into a work without a distinct purpose in mind. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Pacing is like a time version of narrative. The amount of time different parts of the story have the spotlight is very important too. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Characters really carry the story for me. They are the stars of the show, so a lot of thought should be put into who they are and how they interact with one another. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Everything has worldbuilding. Storytelling in essence is worldbuilding. Setting up new rules and creating a sense of immersion. It's not just about
        the history or magic system, even a rom-com has worldbuilding. In a work with good worldbuilding, the audience is made to truly understand (or intentionally not understand)
        the world they are presented with. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that we understand how each category works, let's talk about the actual scoring. As stated previously, we start of with 50% in each category and add or subtract points
        as needed. For example if I believe a work wasn't particularly creative, I'll leave the score at 15, but if I though there were too many tropes and it hurt the end product, 
        I'd take away a few point and bring it down to something like 10 or 5. I do that for each category and at the end convert it all to a percentage and plug it into the chart:
    </p>
    <div class="score_system">
        <dt>95-100% - 10</dt>
        <dt>90-94% - 9</dt>
        <dt>80-89% - 8</dt>
        <dt>70-79% - 7</dt>
        <dt>60-69% - 6</dt>
        <dt>50-59% - 5</dt>
        <dt>35-49% - 4</dt>
        <dt>20-34% - 3</dt>
        <dt>10-19% - 2</dt>
        <dt>0-9% - 1</dt>
    </div>
